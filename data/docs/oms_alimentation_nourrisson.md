## 1. Exclusive breastfeeding (0–6 months)

The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.
No other food or liquid, including water, is recommended during this period.

### Benefits of exclusive breastfeeding
- Protection against gastrointestinal, respiratory, and ear infections
- Reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
- Optimal cognitive and sensory development
- Composition adapted to the infant's needs at each stage
- Protection against chronic diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes)

### Recommended frequency (breastfeeding)
- On demand, without time restrictions
- Minimum 8 to 12 feeds per 24 hours during the first weeks
- Duration per feed: varies by infant (10 to 45 minutes)
- Hunger cues: waking, sucking hands, lip movements
- Do not wait for crying (late hunger cue)

## 2. Mixed feeding and formula feeding (bottle)

When breastfeeding is not possible or is supplemented with formula:

### Recommended bottle volumes by age
- **0–1 month**: 60–90 ml per bottle, every 2–3 hours (8–12 bottles/day)
- **1–2 months**: 90–120 ml per bottle, every 3 hours (7–8 bottles/day)
- **2–3 months**: 120–150 ml per bottle, every 3–4 hours (6–7 bottles/day)
- **3–4 months**: 150–180 ml per bottle, every 4 hours (5–6 bottles/day)
- **4–6 months**: 180–210 ml per bottle, every 4–5 hours (4–5 bottles/day)

### Recommended total daily volume
- General rule: 150 ml/kg/day (± 30 ml depending on appetite)
- Do not exceed 1,000 ml per day before complementary feeding begins
- Example: 4 kg baby → approximately 600 ml/day spread across bottles

### Satiety signals to respect
- Never force an infant to finish a bottle
- Respect satiety signals: turns head away, releases teat, falls asleep
- Self-regulation is an innate skill to preserve

## 3. Complementary feeding (from 6 months)

The introduction of complementary foods should begin at 6 full months, while maintaining breastfeeding until age 2 or beyond.

### Readiness signs for complementary feeding
- Holds head upright and steady
- Sits with slight support
- Loss of the extrusion reflex (no longer systematically spits out food)
- Shows interest in food

### Foods to introduce gradually
- Cooked puréed vegetables (carrot, courgette, sweet potato)
- Puréed fresh fruits (apple, pear, banana)
- Gluten-free cereals first (rice, maize)
- Meat/fish from 6 months (10–20 g/day initially)

### Foods to avoid before 1 year
- Honey (risk of botulism)
- Added salt and sugar
- Cow's milk as the main drink
- Whole nuts, small hard pieces (choking hazard)
- Processed meats, ready meals

## 4. Growth charts and weight monitoring

### WHO growth standards (WHO 2006)
The WHO publishes international reference growth charts used worldwide.

### Normal weight gain rates
- **0–3 months**: 200–300 g/week (approximately 1 kg/month)
- **3–6 months**: 100–200 g/week
- **6–12 months**: 50–100 g/week
- Doubles birth weight around 4–5 months
- Triples birth weight around 12 months

### Alerts to watch for
- Weight loss > 10% of birth weight (physiological up to day 5, should recover by day 10–14)
- Weight stagnation > 2 weeks
- Insufficient weight gain: < 150 g/week before 3 months

## 5. Hydration

### Water requirements
- **< 6 months exclusive breastfeeding**: no additional water needed (breast milk is 87% water)
- **< 6 months bottle-fed**: do not dilute formula; use boiled water for preparation
- **> 6 months**: offer water alongside meals (50–100 ml/meal)

### Bottle temperature
- Ideally warm (37°C)
- Avoid bottles that are too hot (risk of burns)
- Test on the wrist to check temperature

---

## 6. Positioning and bottle technique

### Best practices
- Hold the infant semi-reclined (45°), never flat
- Tilt the bottle to prevent air ingestion
- Take breaks to burp (every 30–60 ml)
- Discard any bottle not consumed within one hour
- Never leave a bottle in the cot

### Teats and bottles
- Flow rate appropriate for age (slow flow 0–3 months, medium 3–6 months)
- Glass or BPA-free plastic bottles
- Sterilise for the first 6 months

---

## 7. Regurgitation and reflux

### Physiological regurgitation (normal)
- Common before 4–6 months (immature cardiac sphincter)
- No pain, no weight loss = normal
- Decreases with complementary feeding and when sitting upright

### Warning signs (pathological GOR)
- Excessive crying, arching
- Feeding refusal, weight loss
- Apnoeas, recurrent pneumonia → consult a paediatrician
