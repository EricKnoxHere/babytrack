## 1. Infant formulas: French classifications

### Stage 1 formula (0–6 months)
Mandatory until complementary feeding begins. Composition regulated by the EU.
- Proteins: 1.8–3 g/100 kcal
- Lipids: 4.4–6 g/100 kcal
- Carbohydrates: 9–14 g/100 kcal
- Fortified with iron, vitamin D, DHA, ARA

### Stage 2 formula (6–12 months)
- Slightly higher protein content
- Enriched with iron (increased requirements from 6 months)
- Used until 12 full months

### Follow-on milk (1–3 years)
- Not mandatory but recommended by the SFP
- Higher iron and vitamin D content than cow's milk
- Adapted protein levels (reduced compared to cow's milk)

### Specialised formulas
- **HA (hypoallergenic)**: partially hydrolysed proteins, for prevention in atopic-risk infants
- **AR (anti-regurgitation)**: enriched with starch or carob, thicker flow
- **Lactose-free**: for temporary intolerance (gastroenteritis)
- **Extensive hydrolysate / amino acids**: for cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA)

## 2. Bottle preparation and storage

### Hygienic preparation
1. Wash hands thoroughly
2. Sterilise the bottle and teat (first 6 months)
3. Pour lukewarm water into the bottle first (tap water after 1 month, boiled water before)
4. Add the powder (1 level scoop per 30 ml of water) — always water first
5. Close and gently shake
6. Test temperature on the wrist (approximately 37°C)

### Storage
- Prepared bottle: consume within one hour (at room temperature)
- Prepared bottle in the refrigerator (< 4°C): up to 24 hours
- Water only: can be prepared in advance in sterilised bottles
- Never reheat twice
- Never use a microwave (uneven heating)

## 3. Frequency and volumes by age (SFP)

### Newborn (0–1 month)
- 7 to 10 bottles per 24 hours
- Volume: 60–90 ml per bottle
- Spacing: 2–3 hours, on demand
- Return to birth weight expected by day 10–14

### Infant 1–3 months
- 6 to 8 bottles per 24 hours
- Volume: 90–150 ml per bottle
- Progressive regularisation of feeding schedule
- Do not space feeds more than 4 hours apart at night before 3 months

### Infant 3–6 months
- 5 to 6 bottles per 24 hours
- Volume: 150–210 ml per bottle
- Daily volume: 750–900 ml
- Possible longer night stretch (5–6 hours)

### Infant 6–12 months (with complementary feeding)
- 3 to 4 bottles per day
- Minimum total milk volume: 500 ml
- Bottles complementary to solid meals

## 4. Vitamin D and supplementation

### SFP recommendations (2022 consensus)
- **Vitamin D**: systematic supplementation from birth
  - Exclusive breastfeeding: 1,000–1,200 IU/day
  - Formula feeding (fortified formula): 600–800 IU/day
  - Recommended form: daily oral vitamin D3 solution
- **Vitamin K**: at birth (hospital protocol), extended for 3 months with exclusive breastfeeding
- **Fluoride**: not recommended before 6 months, discussed based on local caries risk

---

## 5. Complementary feeding (SFP 2022)

### French guiding principles
- Start: no earlier than 4 full months, ideally at 6 months
- Never before 4 months (allergy risk, digestive immaturity)
- Gradual introduction: one new food every 3–5 days

### Recommended order of introduction in France
1. **Vegetables**: carrot, courgette, green bean, broccoli (smooth purées)
2. **Fruits**: apple, pear, banana, peach (sugar-free compotes)
3. **Cereals**: rice, maize (infant flour)
4. **Meat/fish/eggs**: from 6 months (10 g → 20 g progressively)
5. **Legumes**: with caution after 8 months
6. **Gluten**: between 4 and 12 months (early exposure recommended)

### Major allergens: early introduction recommended
Contrary to former recommendations, the SFP now recommends early introduction of allergens (from 4–6 months) to reduce allergy risk:
- Peanut (diluted peanut butter)
- Egg (cooked)
- Fish
- Gluten
- Exception: if an allergic reaction occurs → specialist referral

## 6. Breastfeeding: SFP position

### Recommended duration
- Exclusive: 6 months (WHO/SFP consensus)
- Extended: up to 1–2 years alongside complementary feeding
- Gradual weaning recommended, never abrupt

### Breastfeeding support
- Latch within the first hour after birth
- No supplementary feeds without medical indication in the first 48 hours
- Seek advice for pain, nipple soreness, engorgement

---

## 7. Signs of inadequate feeding

### Warning signals to watch for
- Weight loss > 10% of birth weight (paediatric monitoring required)
- Fewer than 6 wet nappies per day after day 5
- Inconsolable infant, constant crying
- Fewer than 5 stools per week before 1 month (breastfed)
- Confirmed weight stagnation over 2 weigh-ins 15 days apart

### Assessing adequate intake
- 5–8 wet nappies per 24 hours = adequate hydration
- Alert and vigorous between feeds
- Weight curve following reference percentiles

---

## 8. Crying and infantile colic

### Colic (3-month colic)
- Definition: crying > 3 hours/day, > 3 days/week, > 3 weeks (rule of 3s)
- Peaks at 6 weeks, resolves spontaneously around 3–4 months
- No drug treatment has proven effective
- Approach: babywearing, abdominal massage, probiotics (L. reuteri, moderate evidence)
- Rule out lactase deficiency, GOR, CMPA before concluding "simple colic"

### Distinguishing hunger crying from colic
- Hunger crying: soothed by breastfeeding or bottle
- Colic: persists despite feeding, arching, flushed face
- Important not to overfeed in an attempt to "stop" the crying

## 9. Summary table of daily volumes

| Age           | Bottles/day | Volume per bottle | Daily total  |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 0–1 month     | 7–10        | 60–90 ml          | 500–700 ml   |
| 1–2 months    | 6–8         | 90–120 ml         | 600–750 ml   |
| 2–3 months    | 6–7         | 120–150 ml        | 700–800 ml   |
| 3–4 months    | 5–6         | 150–180 ml        | 750–900 ml   |
| 4–6 months    | 4–5         | 180–210 ml        | 750–900 ml   |
| 6–12 months*  | 3–4         | 210–240 ml        | 500–700 ml   |
