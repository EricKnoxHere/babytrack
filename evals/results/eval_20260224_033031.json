While this is not concerning if he is satisfied and gaining weight normally, monitor whether he shows hunger cues within 3 hours.\n- **No night feed documented**: The last feed at 21:30 is followed by a 9-hour gap until the morning feed at 06:30. For a 2-month-old, this is at the upper limit of acceptable spacing. Ensure Tom is not waking hungry during the night; if he is, offer a night feed (formula or breast).\n- **Breastfeeding volumes unknown**: The data notes \"130 ml (breastfeeding)\" but actual breast milk intake cannot be directly measured. Ensure Tom is producing 5\u20138 wet nappies and 2\u20135 stools daily as indirect indicators of adequate breastfeeding.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Recommendations\n\n1. **Monitor weight gain and satiety signals**: Confirm Tom is gaining 100\u2013200 g/week (appropriate for 1\u20133 months). Watch for early hunger cues (hand-to-mouth, rooting) within the 3-hour intervals. If he consistently feeds for < 10 minutes or shows hunger < 2 hours after a feed, consider offering slightly larger volumes (120\u2013130 ml per bottle).\n\n2. **Assess night feeding**: If Tom sleeps through the 21:30 \u2192 06:30 gap without waking, this is excellent. **However**, if he is waking hungry or unsettled, introduce a night feed (formula or expressed breast milk) around 23:00\u201300:00 to bridge this 9-hour interval. At 2 months, some babies still need night nutrition.\n\n3. **Continue breastfeeding support**: Maintain the mixed feeding approach if it is working. If breastfeeding is established and Tom appears satisfied, no changes are needed. If there are concerns (pain, poor latch, unclear milk transfer), consult a lactation specialist.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Summary\n\n**Tom's feeding on 23/02/2026 is well-structured and meets WHO/SFP guidelines for a 2-month-old**: regular 3-hour intervals, appropriate volumes (720 ml total), and balanced mixed feeding\u2014provided he is gaining weight normally and showing no signs of hunger during the long night interval.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d When to consult a paediatrician\n\nContact your doctor if:\n- Tom loses weight or gains < 100 g/week\n- He has fewer than 5 wet nappies per day\n- He shows persistent hunger cues within 1\u20132 hours of feeding\n- He is unsettled or cries inconsolably despite feeding\n\n**Otherwise, continue monitoring growth and keep this feeding log updated.
